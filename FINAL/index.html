			<div id="mine2">
			<p>Hi, welcome to my website, I coded it myself! I'm a CT/NY based, multi-facited performer finally getting her feet wet in the business.  When I was 5 I got to be in my first musical, <em> Charlie and the Chololate Factory </em> and was cast as the leader of the line of child Oompa Loompa's and right when I walked onto the stage my first show, I was hooked.  I've been doing it constantly since then, even though I try to culminate other hobbies. I love museums, painting, being a cat mom, and teaching children's theatre: anything that makes me more worldly of a person since I think that aspect is an important part to being an actor.  Anyway, feel free to explore and contact me~ Thank you!    </p>
